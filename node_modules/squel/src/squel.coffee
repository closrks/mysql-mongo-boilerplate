# An SQL expression builder.

# SQL expressions are used in WHERE and ON clauses to filter data by various criteria.

# traverses this tree in order to build the final expression string.
#
# Expressions can be nested. Nested expression contains can themselves contain nested expressions.
# When rendered a nested expression will be fully contained within brackets.
#
# All the build methods in this object return the object instance for chained method calling purposes.
